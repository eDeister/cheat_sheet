      <h2>Ideal Scenario</h2>
      <p>
          In the ideal scenario, edits are made sequentially and by one team member at a time.
          For example, if someone wanted to make changes to multiple pages, they would first ask
          if anyone was currently working on the website. Assuming the answer is no, they would then
          pull the latest changes from the repo using the "git pull" command in their SSH session.
          Lastly, they download the changes from WHFS, make their changes, and add-commit-push to github.
          Then repeat for the next student.
      </p>
      <h2>Undo changes before git commit</h2>
      <p>
          To revert changes before a commit is made, a four-step process must be followed:
      </p>
      <ol>
          <li>Delete the file with the unwanted changes from the local directory (left side of PHPStorm.)
              This should automatically delete the page from WHFS (right side) but if it didn't, the page
              can be deleted manually.</li>
          <li>Execute a checkout in the terminal: "git checkout -- filename"</li>
          <li>Get the latest changes from github using git pull</li>
          <li>Refresh the remote host connection in PHPStorm and download the files.</li>
      </ol>
