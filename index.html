      <h2>Ideal Scenario</h2>
      <p>
          In the ideal scenario, edits are made sequentially and by one team member at a time.
          For example, if someone wanted to make changes to multiple pages, they would first ask
          if anyone was currently working on the website. Assuming the answer is no, they would then
          pull the latest changes from the repo using the "git pull" command in their SSH session.
          Lastly, they download the changes from WHFS, make their changes, and add-commit-push to github.
          Then repeat for the next student. This way of doing things ensures there will never be any
          merge conflicts.
      </p><br>

      <h2>Undo changes before git commit</h2>
      <p>
          To revert changes before a commit is made, a four-step process must be followed:
      </p>
      <ol>
          <li>Delete the file with the unwanted changes from the local directory (left side of PHPStorm.)
              This should automatically delete the page from WHFS (right side) but if it didn't, the page
              can be deleted manually.</li>
          <li>Execute a checkout in the terminal: "git checkout -- filename"</li>
          <li>Get the latest changes from github using git pull</li>
          <li>Refresh the remote host connection in PHPStorm and download the files.</li>
      </ol><br>

      <h2>Undo changes after git commit</h2>
      <p>
          To undo a commit, you can use the command "git revert HEAD" followed by "git push". Note that
          the Vim editor will pop up in the terminal after git revert, which will need to be closed by
          typing ":x" and enter.
      </p><br>

      <h2>Conflict scenario</h2>
      <p>
          The conflict scenario emerges when two or more collaborators make changes to the same file(s)
          at the same location. To configure git to handle conflicts in the desired way, you have to
          encounter a merge conflict, then do a git pull, and finally enter "git config pull.rebase false".
          Each member must perform this step once per project.
      </p>
      <p>
          To handle the conflict itself, you have to do a git pull, download the file to localhost, edit
          the file back to the desired state, then do an add-commit-push. All members should then do a pull
          to get the latest changes.
      </p><br>

      <h2>Communication principles</h2>
      <p>
          Sajal and I plan to communicate over discord before and after making <i>any</i> changes to a file.
          This includes something as simple as changing a header or adding a comment. Being clear about what
          you are doing is the best way to both avoid merge conflicts and stay organized.
